# Jammming
This was built as a final React course project while undertaking the Web Development path on Codecademy.

This application uses only React to display components and make requests to the Spotify API.

The user is able to search for tracks in the Spotify database, add them to a new playlist, give the playlist a name, and save the playlist to their account.

This project uses the latest JavaScript syntax along with asynchronous functions to perform requests to the API and display the results.
